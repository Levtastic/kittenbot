Kitten IRC bot, built on the python irc framework (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc/13.1)

Effort has been made to keep all kitten-like code in the database, and not in the actual bot code. The intention is for the bot to be easily re-used as any kind of response bot.

Highly configurable through database values, and highly modular allowing new functionality to be bolted on.

Basically a "my first irc bot" project, and also a "my first git repo" experience.

There's a [wiki](https://github.com/Levtastic/kittenbot/wiki) detailing some of the nuts and bolts of the bot.
