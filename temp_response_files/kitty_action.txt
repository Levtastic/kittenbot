meows.
bats a ball of yarn around.
meows quietly in the corner.
rubs up against !SOMEONE's legs.
curls up on the floor.
scratches at the door to be let out
curls up in a ray of sunlight
claws at !SOMEONE's leg
climbs up onto !SOMEONE's lap and goes to sleep
sits down in front of !SOMEONE and mews at them
tears up !SOMEONE's socks
excitedly explores the channel
sits on lingrush's head
yawns
has itchy paws
drags in a dead bird
paws at nothing particular in the air
lies down on !SOMEONE's feet
sheds on some furniture
attacks a spot on the floor
rolls over contentedly, paws dangling in the air.
hides a dead bird under a cushion
falls over clumsily and looks confused
vomits in !SOMEONE's shoe
farts
curls up on !SOMEONE's keyboard
